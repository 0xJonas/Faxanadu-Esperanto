#26
Post kiam mi
longe vojaĝis,
mi revenis al
mia hejmurbeto/
sed trovis ĝin 
preskaŭ
dezerta./
La pordego
estas malferm-
ita, la homoj
mankas,/
la muroj
pecetiĝas...
Sed kion okazis
ĉi tie?

===

#27
Bonvolu tuj
renkonti la
reĝon,/
kvankam vi 
ĵus alvenis.

===

#28
Iru orienten
kaj vi trovos
la urbeto de
Apolune.

===

#29
Estas signo de
"Jack" apud la
ŝlosiltruo. ???

===

#2a
Ĉi tie estas la
elfa urbeto
Eolis./
Ĝi situas ĉe la
fundo de la
mondarbo/
kaj estas la 
hejmo de la
elfoj./
Vizitu la 
Guru-on antaŭ
renkonti la
reĝon.

===

#2b
Ie ekstere,
ekzistas pli da
ringoj,/ kiuj
helpos vin dum
via vojaĝo./
Serĉu ilin,
unu post la
alia.

===

#2c
Se vi volas
viziti la 
reĝon, prenu
tiun ringon./
Ĝi identigi vin
kiel unu el ni./
Ne perdu ĝin.

===

#2d
Vizitu ĉiuj
Guru-oj laŭ via
vojaĝo./
Ili donos al vi
honoran rangon
laŭ via sperto.

===

#2e
La lasta
puto preskaŭ
tute sekiĝas.#???

===

#2f
Estas fonto
en la urbeto
Forepaw.

===

#30
La nanoj jam
eniris la
urbeton./
ŝajnas ke la
fino estas
proksime.

===

#31
ĉu vi havas ion
por batali
kontraŭ la
nanojn?

===

#32
Mi ne povas
lasi vin eniri!

===

#33
La reĝo
atendas vin.

===

#34
Bonan vojaĝon!

===

#35:
Glad you could
come.
Disaster has
befallen us./
The Elf
fountain water,
our life source,
has stopped./
The wells are
drying up./
Many men went
out and nobody
came back./
You are our last
hope.
I shall give you
1500 Golds./
Prepare
for your journey
with this money./
It will be a
dangerous
journey./
Take care
of yourself.

===


#36:
There is nothing
more I can do to
help you./
Looking forward
to good news.

===


#37:
The Dwarfs
are robbing
the Elves' money
and jewelry.

===


#38:
A meteorite fell
into the World
Tree and
created havoc./
At the end of
the confusion,/
the Dwarfs of
the underworld
came up/
and attacked
the Elves.
Nobody knows
the reason.

===


#39:
Listen to
people./
You'll only get
frustrated
if you just walk
around.

===


#3A:
Don't try
too hard.

===


#3B:
Welcome to the
town of Apolune.

===


#3C:
There is the
town of Forepaw
ahead of you.

===


#3D:
There are Dwarfs
all over in the
Tower of Trunk./
Go out of town,
turn right and
go straight,/
then you'll find
the Tower
of Trunk.

===


#3E:
Good luck.

===


#3F:
You should have
a shield. It'll
protect you from
Dwarf attacks.

===


#40:
The Mattock
should be in the
Tower./
You can get it
by defeating a
Dwarf.

===


#41:
We blocked the
passage to the
next town by
building a wall,/
but the Dwarfs
keep coming.

===


#42:
If you have the
Mattock,you can
break the wall,/
but if you don't
have it...

===


#43: (unused)
You need a key.

===


#44: (unused)
You need a
different key.

===


#45:
Are you hurt?
Our doctor
can help.

===


#46:
Watch out for
the jar of
poison./
The poison will
take your energy
away.

===


#47:
Did you learn
the Guru's
mantra?/
The mantra will
return you to
this world./
Hold on to the
mantra.

===


#48:
There is a
secret Guru in
the Tower of
Fortress./
You'll find
important infor-
mation and
a key there.

===


#49:
You can carry 8
items. They are
all important.
Choose well.

===


#4A:
This is the town
of Forepaw.

===


#4B:
If the fountain
flows,water will
come back to the
town.

===


#4C:
Water from 3
springs flows
into the
fountain./
Find the 3
springs and
return the water
to the fountain.

===


#4D:
Water is flowing
in our fountain.
Thanks to
your help.

===


#4E:
I hear
quite often
about a fountain
in the sky./
When you go down
from the town,/
you'll come to a
place where the
sky opens above./
They say a
fountain is up
in the sky,/
but you need
Wing Boots...

===


#4F:
If you can push
the rock away
from the
fountain,/
you'll find the
way to Mascon./
But, you can't
move it without
the Ring of
Ruby./
The old man of
the spring will
have it.
Ask him.

===


#50:
There is a
spring
in the tower of
Fortress./
You'll find the
dried up
fountain/
and the entrance
to the tower
right above
this town./
So long.

===


#51:
The Dwarf
who lives
in the tower
has Wing boots./
When you get
them, look for
a fountain
in the sky.

===


#52:
When you push
the rock
away from the
fountain,/
you'll find
the passage
to Mascon,/
but you need
the Ring
of Ruby.

===


#53: (unused)
Look for
Wing Boots.

===


#54:
Go below the
blue sky. You'll
find a fountain
in the sky.

===


#55:
Use this key
to open the door
below./
You'll find the
first spring.

===


#56:
If you don't
have a Joker
key,
come back again.

===


#57:
Ho, ho, ho.
I'll tell you
about the water
of the spring./
.....
.....
Oops!
..fallen asleep./
The water was
poisoned./
The posion is
almost gone so
it's all right
to wake him up./
Watch.
..... .....
Something is
wrong.../
Oops!

===


#58:
Get the key from
the Guri in the
tower of
Fortress and/
search for the
undiscovered
first fountain.

===


#59:
You've done well
to get here.
This is the
spring of Trunk./
You need Elixir
to revive the
spring./
Will you give me
your medicine?

===


#5A:
This spring will
flow again.
There are
two more./
You'd better go
and find them.

===


#5B:
Come back with
the medicine.

===


#5C:
As soon as water
flows in the
fountain,/
go to Mascon and
find the poison
the Dwarfs hide,/
otherwise the
Elves will be
destroyed.

===


#5D:
Thank you for
coming./
I will revive
the spring
right away.

===


#5E:
I'll give you
the Ring of
Ruby./
Now, push the
rock away from
the fountain.

===


#5F:
Trust
your power./
You are the
chosen warrior
to rescue
this world.

===


#60:
What business do
you have here?/
This is the
misty town of
Mascon.

===


#61:
The tower of
Forepaw is still
far away./
Prepare well
and go.

===


#62:
When the meteor-
ite is dissolved
in water,/
it becomes
poison which
will bring
sickness./
It started when
the Dwarfs
brought it into
the World Tree.

===


#63:
Did you get the
pendant? It will
strengthen your
offense power.

===


#64:
There are stores
outside town./
They sell useful
items,/
though it's
inconvenient to
get there./
I wonder if you
could find them.
Look up while
you walk.

===


#65:
It is a large
and beautiful
shield.

===


#66:
The meteorite is
meditated on
at the tower of
Suffer./
You'll find the
Tower above a
Guru.
Be careful.

===


#67:
You need Wing
Boots/
in order to get
to the misty
town of Victim./
Look for them in
the Tower of
Suffer.

===


#68:
This town has
been covered
with a mist ever/
since the mete-
orite hit the
town./
Some areas
might still
be burning.

===


#69:
The house
outside town was
abandoned/
and the Dwarfs
are living
there./
Watch out for
them.

===


#6A:
You'll get to
the Tower of
Suffer soon.

===


#6B:
The pendant has
been a treasure
of the town./
But it is best
for the town if
you keep it.

===


#6C:
The Dwarfs are
chanting their
mantras/
to a segment of
the meteorite./
They believe it
has special
cosmic power.

===


#6D:
The meteorite
which was in the
Tower of Suffer/
has been moved
to the Tower of
Mist./
The Dwarfs must
have learned of
your coming.

===


#6E:
They say the
Hour Glass will
enable you/
to move around
while the time
stops.

===


#6F:
The Hour Glass
will exhaust
your energy,/
so be careful
when you use it.

===


#70:
Welcome to the
Town of Victim./
I have been
unable to leave
town.

===


#71:
It is dangerous
to leave town
unless you have
a magic shield.

===


#72:
There is a magic
hall outside
town.

===


#73:
There is a magic
cane which will
give you magic
power.

===


#74:
The door to the
Capital town
below is open.
Go to it now.

===


#75:
It was only a
rumor. Sorry
about that./
I got this armor
in exchange for
a bottle./
If you wish,
you can have it.

===


#76:
I'll have a
drink.
Well...
not yet.

===


#77:
Looks like
I'm lost.

===


#78:
I'm lost.
My magic
does not work.

===


#79:
It can be magic
of justice
or a magic of
destruction./
It all depends
on who uses it.

===


#7A: (unused)
Magics have
individual
powers.

===


#7B:
Magic of offence
is effective,
but it consumes
power.

===


#7C:
When you hold
the Dwarf's
meteorite in
your hand,/
it will become
Black Onyx with
power inside.

===


#7D:
If you go
straight ahead,/
you will get to
the Tower of
Mist./
If you defeat
the dwarf who
lives in the
Tower/
and get the
meteorite,
come back here.

===


#7E:
As long as there
are crazed
Dwarfs,/
the deadly
threat of the
meteorite/
will loom over
the Elves./
Use this key to
open the next
door to get to
Conflate./
Fight for the
Elves.

===


#7F:
I give keys to
travelers like
yourself./
You have an
"Ace" key,
don't you?

===


#80:
This is a
trading town
called
Conflate.

===


#81:
You'll find the
legendary shield
and helmet/
in the World of
Branch.

===


#82:
The town is
surrounded by
doors for
protection.

===


#83:
When you get the
shield and
helmet, go to
see the Guru.

===


#84:
I am a guardian
of the Guru.
He is an im-
portant person.

===


#85:
There should be
something you
can get.

===


#86:
Don't rely on
your magic power/
during the final
battle with the
Dwarfs.

===


#87:
The town used to
prosper from
trading with the
Dwarfs.

===


#88:
They are
terrible now,/
but they used to
be skilled
craftsmen.

===


#89:
I used to go to
the town of
Dwarfs quite
often/
when we had
business with
them.

===


#8A:
Do you want to
know what I do?/
I am
the pickpocket
Gingi./
I'm an important
person around
here.

===


#8B: (unused)
Don't rely on
your magic power/
only during the
final fight
against the
Dwarfs./
You can wear the
Battle Helmet
and Battle Suit/
only when you
have the Dragon
Slayer./
You will not be
able to return
us the Dragon
Slayer/
until we have
true peace here.

===


#8C:
Don't rely on
your magic power/
alone during the
last fight
against the
Dwarfs./
You can wear the
Battle Helmet
and Battle Suit/
only when you
have the Dragon
Slayer./
You will not be
able to return
us the Dragon
Slayer/
until we have
true peace here./
This ring will
open the door to
Dartmoor. Take
it with you.

===


#8D:
Daydreak is a
town at the
border.

===


#8E:
I have friends
in Dartmoor/
which is known
as an evil
place.

===


#8F:
Look for the
Battle Suit.

===


#90:
Did you find the
magic cane?

===


#91:
You are the
famous warrior./
You are as good
looking as I've
heard.

===


#92:
You are the
warrior everyone
is talking
about./
Could I have
your autograph?/
Are you busy
now? Well, will
you come to
visit me?/
My name is Moto.
Please don't
forget.

===


#93:
Look at you!
When did you
last take a
bath?

===


#94:
The Guru of
Conflate has the
Ring of Dwarfs.

===


#95:
Did you get the
Battle Suit?

===


#96:
The castle of
Dartmoor is a
complex maze.

===


#97:
Is this your
first visit to
this store?
It is my first.

===


#98:
Have not seen
you for a while.
You'll find a
magic cane/
when you get
above the tower
of Pillar.

===


#99: (unused)
There is the
Castle of
Fraternal/
down below the
town of
Dartmoor.

===


#9A: (unused)
You need the
Demon's Ring/
to get into the
fortress of
Zenis.

===


#9B:
Dragon Slayer is
in the hands of
king of the
Dwarfs.

===


#9C:
Defeat the Evil
one with Dragon
Slayer.

===


#9D:
Go to see the
Guru in the
Castle of
Fraternal.

===


#9E:
If you see the
Guru, he'll give
you the Demon's
Ring.

===


#9F:
Search inside
the castle.
You should find
a Guru.

===


#A0:
The magic of
offence does not
work against the
Evil one.

===


#A1:
The Dwarfs re-
gard the meteor-
ite as a cosmic
messenger./
It is a dreadful
thing as you
already know./
It turns into a
poison when
dissolved in
water./
It is not incon-
ceivable that/
you would ex-
perience mental
and physical
changes/
when you are
near or touch
it./
That is why the
Dwarfs have
changed and gone
crazy.

===


#A2:
The monster
you've just de-
feated is King
Grieve,/
the king of the
Dwarfs. The Evil
One changed his
appearance./
The king pro-
tected the sword
from the Evil
One/
by hiding it
within his own
body./
Use the sword to
defeat the Evil
One in the
fortress./
This will open
the door to the
fortress.

===


#A3:
I'll meditate
for you.

===


#A4:
Glad to have you
back safely./
It will take
time,
but the Elves
and the Dwarfs/
will become
friends and re-
turn the peace
to this land/
as it used to
be. I understand
you will leave/
to continue your
journey.
What a restless
guy!

===


#A5:
There is the
mark of "Queen"
by the key hole.

===


#A6:
There is the
mark of "King"
by the key hole.

===


#A7:
There is the
mark of "Ace"
by the key hole.

===


#A8:
There is the
mark of "Joker"
by the key hole.

a ring
to open a door?
